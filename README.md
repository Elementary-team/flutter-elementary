## Elementary overview

Elementary is a simple and reliable way to build applications with MVVM in Flutter.
Benefits from using:

- maximum Flutter-like, you don't need to spend a lot of time learning the library if you are already familiar with the
  standard Flutter approaches;
- splitting code into different layers by responsibility, that bring low coupling, make code simpler as well as more
  readable;
- high testability of all layers from widgets to business logic;
- speed boost for a team consisting of more than one person, due to the easy sharing of independent task-parts among
  team members.
