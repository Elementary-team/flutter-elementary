## Elementary Overview

Elementary is a simple and reliable way to build applications with MVVM in Flutter. Benefits of using Elementary include:

- **Maximum Flutter-like**: You don't need to spend a lot of time learning the library if you are already familiar with the standard Flutter approaches.
- **Code separation by responsibility**: Splitting code into different layers reduces coupling, making the code simpler and more readable.
- **High testability**: All layers, from widgets to business logic, are highly testable.
- **Team efficiency**: It boosts speed for teams consisting of more than one person, due to the easy sharing of independent task parts among team members.

## Environment

To reduce the amount of boilerplate and manual work, Elementary offers a few options:

- [elementary_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/elementary_cli): A command line utility that helps with boilerplate generation.
- [Plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18099-elementary): A plugin for the IntelliJ IDE family, based on elementary_cli.
- [Plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ElementaryTeam.elementary): A plugin for VSCode, based on elementary_cli.
- [elementary brick](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/elementary): A command line utility that helps with boilerplate generation, based on Mason.

## Examples

- [Country](https://github.com/Elementary-team/flutter-elementary/tree/main/examples/country): A general example of how to use Elementary for development.

- [Elementary with Redux](https://github.com/Elementary-team/flutter-elementary/tree/main/examples/elementary_redux): An example of how to use Elementary with Redux.

- [Profile](https://github.com/Elementary-team/flutter-elementary/tree/main/examples/profile): An example demonstrating a feature that spans separate screens, and how to use Elementary with Bloc.
