Depends on your IDE and personal preferences choose and install one of those tools:

- [plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18099-elementary)
- [plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ElementaryTeam.elementary)
- [elementary brick](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/elementary)
- [elementary_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/elementary_cli);

Or can skip this step and create Widgets, Widget Models, Models manually further.
