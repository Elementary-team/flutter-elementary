## What this library is

This is an implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm#the-mvvm-pattern) pattern
for Flutter applications. 

## Description

The current implementation follows the rules of the [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm#the-mvvm-pattern) architecture pattern, is inspired by the internal implementation of Flutter, and incorporates positive aspects from the [Business Logic Component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS36gBEp8OI) architecture pattern and Clean Architecture principles.


#### Benefits of using

- **Clear Layer Separation:** 
The code is divided into layers with distinct responsibilities, making it easy even for newbie developers to get started with the library.

- **High Independence Between Layers:** 
This decoupling simplifies testing and maintenance. It also allows team members to work independently on different layers while developing a single feature, which leads to decreasing time-to-feature.

- **Ease of Testing:**
The easier it is to test, the more cases are covered. This approach supports various test types, such as unit, widget, golden, and end-to-end tests. Writing tests with Elementary requires minimal additional effort, providing strong motivation to do it.

- **Fully Declarative Widget Layer:**
The widget layer remains purely declarative, devoid of any logic. This aligns with Flutter's focus on declarative UI, with other layers handling the logic.

- **Efficient rebuilds:**
Flutterâ€™s optimized rebuild strategies are crucial for performance. Elementary uses the observer pattern for properties, minimizing unnecessary rebuilds and enhancing application efficiency.
