## Overview

Elementary is a simple and reliable way to build applications with MVVM in Flutter. Benefits of using Elementary include:

- **Maximum Flutter-like**: You don't need to spend a lot of time learning the library if you are already familiar with the standard Flutter approaches.
- **Code separation by responsibility**: Splitting code into different layers reduces coupling, making the code simpler and more readable.
- **High testability**: All layers, from widgets to business logic, are highly testable.
- **Team efficiency**: It boosts speed for teams consisting of more than one person, due to the easy sharing of independent task parts among team members.
