# Elementary with Redux example

We'd like to show you a small example of how **Elementary** works well with **Redux**.

App description:

* The program downloads and displays a randomly selected dog photo when you click the "plus" button.
* When you restart the application, the downloaded data remains on the screen rather than being downloaded over the network.
* All photos should be deleted once you click the "cross."

For API workflow, we use dio, and for state management, we use redux and redux epics.
